## Quasar App Extension MyComponent

This is an example of a Quasar App Extension that injects a custom component and a Quasar Plugin into the hosting Quasar app. In this case, we'll be injecting the [AppVisibility](https://quasar.dev/quasar-plugins/app-visibility) plugin for use by our App Extension.

Take into the account that for this example, the `ext-id` of this App Extension is `inject-quasar-plugin` (this can be anything, and please do change it for a more appropriate name for your App Extension).
