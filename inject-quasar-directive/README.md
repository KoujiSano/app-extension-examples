## Quasar App Extension MyComponent

This is an example of a Quasar App Extension that injects a custom component and a Quasar Directive into the hosting Quasar app In this case, we'll be injecting the [ClosePopup](https://quasar.dev/vue-directives/close-popup) directive for use by our App Extension.

Take into the account that for this example, the `ext-id` of this App Extension is `my-component` (this can be anything, and please do change it for a more appropriate name for your App Extension).
